    <h2>Solution Overview &amp; Benefits</h2>
    <div data-render-html="/solutions/solarear-hearing-aid"><p>From: www.solarear.com.br</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 6000 million people are hearing impaired, This is because of lack of prevention and treatment of diseases as well as higher noise pollution in several employment sectors. In its more severe form, this disorder is keeping otherwise healthy children and adults from going to school and working as they are considered deaf, even if they are not. The extent of hearing loss leads to poverty and hardship in the families and communities affected, and through extension, to the larger society. Those effected suffer from the lack of educational and occupational opportunities. People with disabilities account for a higher per cent age of unemployed than national average and have less access to education and training, as well as a higher incidence of HIV.</p>
<p>Through a Brazilian Foundation, Instituto CEFAC plus a social marketing organization Legar, plus several University stakeholders and in conjunction with the youths who are deaf, from an NGO in Africa, Solar Ear Brazil, manufactures, assembles and distributes, the first digital rechargeable hearing aid, a new solar battery charger and rechargeable hearing aid batteries which costs the same as disposible zinc air batteries, but lasts 2 to 3 years. All products are assembled by young employees who are deaf. By developing practical technologies for the region and creating employment, training and education programs, this project is a sustainable professional enterprise, as well as effect the way civil society views the skills of people with disabilities.</p>

    <h2>History &amp; Development</h2>
    <div data-render-html="/solutions/solarear-hearing-aid#history-and-development"><p>This project will ultimately help the less advantaged children in Latin America get low cost hearing aids, which will enable those children to be mainstreamed in local schools. There are very few schools for the deaf in Latin America, especially rural areas. Article 26 of UN Charter on Human Rights, states &quot;everyone has the right to education.&quot; This project aims to give the hearing impaired child improved access to education system. The project will also empower and educate Solar Ear&#39;s employees who are deaf. These initial employees will act as role models, encouraging other unemployed hearing impaired or deaf students in their region. They will be involved in future product changes, innovations and discoveries as well as be the teachers in the next affordable hearing aid project. The hearing aids are available in Brazil.</p>
