        <h3>Solution Overview &amp; Benefits</h3>
        <div data-render-html="/solutions/wello-water-waterwheel"><p>Wello Water has developed a wide range of concepts and designs in collaboration with the WaterWheel’s intended users, and identified the features that were most important to them.  The resulting prototype is the WaterWheel 2.0.</p>
<p>Women spend over 25% of their time each day collecting water. With the WaterWheel, they can now transport 50L at once – between 3 and 5 times the amount of water possible as compared to traditional methods.</p>
<p>The WaterWheel’s cap-in-cap design prevents recontamination at the point of use. The single most effective strategy to reduce incidents of diarrheal disease (the second leading cause of death in children under the age of 5, according to the WHO)</p>
<p>The WaterWheel is manufactured from high-quality, human-safe plastics. It’s designed to be long lasting and handle the roughest terrain.</p>
<p>The WaterWheel’s form was inspired by the shape of the traditional matka – designed to be both aesthetically pleasing and a clear indication of the WaterWheel’s intended purpose (clean water!).</p>
<p>In recognition of the fact that the people who need the WaterWheel the most have the least ability to pay for it, Wello developed a business model that will enable them to offer the WaterWheel at an affordable price. Local manufacturing (in Ahmedabad, India) and CSR partnerships help us keep costs as low as possible.</p>

          <h3>History &amp; Development</h3>
          <div data-render-html="/solutions/wello-water-waterwheel#history-and-development"><p>Wello Water is a social venture with a bold mission: to effectively deliver clean water to a thirsty world.</p>
<p>By reframing the water crisis as an opportunity, Wello has reinvented the wheel and developed a business model that empowers individuals to use the WaterWheel as an income-generating tool to lift their families out of poverty.</p>
<p>By giving people easier access to potable water, the WaterWheel frees up valuable time, and in the process, removes barriers that prevent children from going to school and empowers women to engage in more productive activities. Research shows that when women have extra time, they choose to spend it on activities that boost family income, education, health, and wellbeing. Women with even a few years of education have smaller, healthier families, and are more likely to send their children to school. Female education is a key means of breaking the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>The WaterWheel is available in India.</p>
