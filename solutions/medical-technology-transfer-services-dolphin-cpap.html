        <h3>Solution Overview &amp; Benefits</h3>
        <div data-render-html="/solutions/medical-technology-transfer-services-dolphin-cpap"><p>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy supports the airways of pre-term and low-birth weight newborns, who can breathe spontaneously but inadequately. It is a comfortable alternative to relatively invasive therapies, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>The Dolphin system is designed to protect compromised airways, enhancing patient comfort and optimizing infant outcomes. Its continuous gentle pressure of air decreases the baby’s work of breathing by keeping the alveoli of the lungs open, which allows efficient capillary exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to take place. This helps establish and maintain functional residual capacity, prevents collapse and upper airway obstruction. The Dolphin CPAP also reduces apnea, bradycardia and cyanotic episodes. </p>
<p>100% reusable and cleanable, no disposable parts.
Complete all-in-one CPAP treatment and monitoring device.
Integrated design includes gas mixing, humidification, PEEP chamber, air compressor and pulse-oximiter in one compact unit.</p>
<p>The Dolphin bubble CPAP features electronic mixing for easy, independent adjustment of flow rate and FiO2. It also combines a compact, quiet, and easy-to-operate technology with precise control of gas flow delivery and oxygen concentration. For added patient safety, the Dolphin incorporates a full complement of alarms.</p>

          <h3>History &amp; Development</h3>
          <div data-render-html="/solutions/medical-technology-transfer-services-dolphin-cpap#history-and-development"><p>The CPAP (Continuous Positive Air Pressure) system was developed by Medical Technology Transfer and Services (MTTS) in cooperation with Vietnam National Hospital of Pediatrics (NHP), to respond to the country’s needs for low-cost, high-quality equipment to overcome the high neonatal mortality due to Respiratory Distress of premature babies. Respiratory Distress caused 80% of neonatal mortality at NHP, and nationwide 45% of newborns with Respiratory Distress died within 24 hours from birth in 2005. At that time, neonatal emergency care was concentrated in central hospitals which had limited equipment and were hard to reach for most families, therefore many infants were left without adequate care. After implementing MTTS equipment at the national, provincial and referral hospitals, the neonatal 24h-mortality has decreased significantly both at the NHP and in the whole country. </p>
<p>The equipment has been developed and produced in Vietnam by Medical Technology Transfer and Services (MTTS) on the base of Western standards, but with adjustments to the needs and requirements of low-cost settings and tropical climates. Priorities for MTTS are ease of use, affordability, durability, safety and precise measurement. The CPAP has been distributed mostly through the East Meets West Foundation’s Breath of Life Program, combined with intensive training, follow up, data collection and technical assistance. </p>
