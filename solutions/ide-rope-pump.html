        <h3>Solution Overview &amp; Benefits</h3>
        <div data-render-html="/solutions/ide-rope-pump"><p>The Rope Pump is a hand-operated, low-cost tool for accessing water when the water table depth is out of reach of suction pumps (up to 35m). It is made from low-precision parts, making it cheaper, more reliable and easier to repair than piston pumps. Washers of locally-available material are tied some distance apart on a long loop of rope, which is threaded down into a well and back up through a pipe. As the rope leaves the pipe it passes over a wheel and back down into the well. As the wheel is turned, the washers bring water up in a continuous stream through the pipe.</p>
<p>Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>For depth to water up to 18m, the rope pump can be used for irrigating small plots in addition to other domestic water uses.</li>
<li>For depths of water beyond 18m, the rope pump is best suited for domestic use. Irrigation would be limited to dense agriculture like seedling nurseries</li>
<li>If the rope pumpâ€™s drilled well has a casing, it can be sealed to protect the water, as opposed to wells with treadle pumps</li>
<li>Repairs can be done with local materials, as opposed to many imported piston pumps</li>
<li>Suitable for multiple use/shared use for domestic applications </li>
</ul>

          <h3>History &amp; Development</h3>
          <div data-render-html="/solutions/ide-rope-pump#history-and-development"><p>iDE is an international non-profit dedicated to ending poverty in the developing world not through handouts, but by helping farm families access the tools and knowledge they need to increase their income. </p>
<p>iDE&#39;s origins as a formal organization lie in a visit to a Somalian refugee camp in 1982. It was there that founder Paul Polak noticed a critical lack of transport limiting the economic opportunities of refugees who were relying on manual transportation for all commodities. Following the principle &quot;in technology, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,&quot; iDE re-engineered the local donkey cart and interested local artisans in manufacturing one with a more efficient center of gravity, using abandoned car parts for affordability. The donkey carts were a success; more than 500 were sold, producing $1 million of net income for cart owners.</p>
