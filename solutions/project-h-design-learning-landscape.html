        <h3>Solution Overview &amp; Benefits</h3>
        <div data-render-html="/solutions/project-h-design-learning-landscape"><p>Learning Landscape is a scalable, grid-based playground system for elementary math education. The spatial grid is intended to combine active movement and competition with mathematic curricula, providing an outdoor classroom framework for fun and engaged learning. Because math is universal, Learning Landscape can be adapted for use in any country and can be tailored to a range of skill levels.</p>
<p>The designers conceived of various math-based games to be played within a square grid, which can be built in a 4x4 or 5x5 configuration based on the number of students and space constraints.</p>
</div>

          <h3>History &amp; Development</h3>
          <div data-render-html="/solutions/project-h-design-learning-landscape#history-and-development"><p>For the pilot installation at the Kutamba School for AIDS Orphans in Uganda, a 16-point grid was constructed using reclaimed tires arranged inside a large sand box. The tires mark points on the grid, and during game play, numbers can be written directly on them with chalk. (The tires can also be used as outdoor classroom space when coupled with an integrated bench system.)</p>
<p>The games, including Match Me, Math Musical Chairs, Math Around The World, and more, teach concepts including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as spatial and logical reasoning through individual and team-based competition. Because of the systemâ€™s flexibility, teachers and students are encouraged to invent their own games as well.</p>
<p>Since the Kutamba installation, Project H has installed 4 Learning Landscapes for the Bertie County School District in North Carolina, and one at the Maria Auxiliadora Primary School in Mao, Dominican Republic. The Bertie District (North Carolina) teachers have adapted the system for geography, language arts, and science material, and have helped Project H expand the functionality of the Learning Landscape as a testing/assessment tool. With their feedback, the design team is developing a set of peripherals including small and large whiteboards for outdoor use. Learning Landscape, as an educational tool, is both universally adaptable and context specific, making it functional on a global scale and in variable implementations. Project H has continued its adaptation of the system, working with Palo Alto-based design firm nonobject to develop off-the-shelf retail and tabletop versions available to teachers.</p>
