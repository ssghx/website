    <h2>Solution Overview &amp; Benefits</h2>
    <div data-render-html="/solutions/p-and-g-children-s-safe-drinking-water-pur-purification-sachets"><p>PUR is a powdered mixture that removes pathogenic microorganisms and suspended matter, rendering previously contaminated water safe to drink. PUR contains a chlorine disinfectant (calcium hypochlorite) for killing bacteria and an iron salt coagulant (ferric sulfate) for removing suspended matter, protozoa, and viruses. It also contains a buffer, clay and polymer to provide good coagulation and flocculation. PUR is safe for long-term use by the entire family, including infants, and is considered an effective technology by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>PUR requires only a few simple tools that most target beneficiaries of disaster assistance should have at their disposal:</p>
<pre><code>* a scissor or knife to open the sachet,
* a spoon or other implement to stir the water,
* a cloth fabric to filter the treated water, and
* two vessels (i.e. buckets) with volume capacity of 10 liters or more – the first to be used for the treatment process and the second to be used for storing the treated water.
</code></pre><p>PUR comes in a 4 gram sachet labeled in English. Each sachet treats 10 litres of water. The sachets arrive from the manufacturing facility in cartons containing 20 strips of 12 sachets each, for a total of 240 sachets per carton. Each carton is 25 cm x 11 cm x 15.5 cm (length, width, height).</p>

Butyl Products holds up to 2,000,000 sachets of &#39;PUR&#39; for immediate dispatch worldwide. They are the sole European agent for Procter &amp; Gamble &#39;PUR&#39;.</p>

    <h2>History &amp; Development</h2>
    <div data-render-html="/solutions/p-and-g-children-s-safe-drinking-water-pur-purification-sachets#history-and-development"><p>PUR’s application results in water quality that meets WHO guidelines. In field and laboratory studies, PUR has been proven to eliminate disease-causing microorganisms and to remove virtually all suspended material. PUR results in removal of more than 99.99999% of bacteria (including those that cause cholera and typhoid fever), 99.99% of intestinal viruses (including those that cause hepatitis A), and 99.9% of protozoa (including Giardia and Cryptosporidum). In randomized controlled health intervention studies, PUR has been proven to reduce diarrheal disease incidence by up to 90%, with an average of about 50%. CARE, CDC, AmeriCares, Johns Hopkins University, and the Aquaya Institute have independently monitored PUR in a variety of emergency situations, including floods, refugee camps, and nutrition feeding programs, and concluded that PUR is both practical to use and results in a reduction in diarrheal illness. More than 200 million liters of safe drinking water have been provided by global relief groups using PUR. </p>
