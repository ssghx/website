    <h2>Contact Solution Provider</h2>
    <div data-render-html="/solutions/sun-ovens-international-global-oven#provider"><p>SUN OVENS International, Inc.<br>Elburn, IL<br>60119<br>USA<br>+1 630 208 7273<br><a href="mailto:info@sunoven.com">info@sunoven.com</a>  </p>

    <h2>Solution Overview &amp; Benefits</h2>
    <div data-render-html="/solutions/sun-ovens-international-global-oven"><p>The Global Sun Over meets 70% of the needs of a family of 6 to 8 people using entirely solar generated energy. Food can be boiled, steamed, roasted or baked at cooking temperatures of 360° F / 182° C, suitable for cooking the majority of foods in the developing world. The Appliance weighs only 21 pounds / 9.5 kg and has a life span of more than 20 years.</p>
<p>GLOBAL SUN OVENS® are designed to be as energy efficient as possible, maximising energy to achieve the highest possible temperature and retain highest amount of heat possible, while minimizing weight and negative impacts on the environment. The annual wood consumption for cooking throughout developing countries is 1,000 pounds of wood per person. A family of six using a GLOBAL SUN OVEN® for 80% of their cooking needs would save 4,800 pounds of wood per year, and prevent over 88 tons of CO2 emissions tbeing released into the earth&#39;s atmosphere, over the oven&#39;s 20 year lifespan. </p>
<p>Other than cleaning, no other ongoing maintenance is required.</p>
<p>Due to their durability, ability to be used when there is less sun and the fact that food can be cooked faster, means the GLOBAL SUN OVEN® are less expensive on a cost per meal basis than other solar cooking devices. The high quality materials that are required to make a GLOBAL SUN OVEN® make its initial cost higher but its overall cost lower than any other solar cooking device. In areas where people can not afford to purchase an oven outright micro-finance programs are utilized to allow ovens to be paid in small installments using money that would have otherwise been spent purchasing charcoal.</p>
<p>The price of GLOBAL SUN OVEN® can be reduced by assembling them in the countries in which they will be used. SUN OVENS International has developed a local assembly plant system, enabling GLOBAL SUN OVEN® to be made in the area they will be used, dramatically reducing the cost of the ovens and shipping. This complete assembly system includes the training, tools, instructional materials and follow-up support necessary.</p>

    <h2>History &amp; Development</h2>
    <div data-render-html="/solutions/sun-ovens-international-global-oven#history-and-development"><p>Over 2 billion people cook with wood, charcoal or dung as their primary cooking fuel and the social, economic and environmental impacts are significant. The GLOBAL SUN OVEN® has been engineered to provide an alternative to using wood and dung, fuels that are becoming increasingly scarce and costly. The use of these solar ovens can be very beneficial to women all over the world by reducing the cost of fuel and/or lightening the everyday burdens of life.</p>
<p>NGO&#39;s that have worked with SUN OVEN® have found that they have had an easier time getting people to use them because these solar ovens work so well and maintain cooking temperatures that are significantly higher than other types of solar devices.</p>
