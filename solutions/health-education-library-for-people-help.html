          <h3>History &amp; Development</h3>
          <div data-render-html="/solutions/health-education-library-for-people-help#history-and-development"><p>Patient education is an integral part of health care delivery across medical centers in developed countries thus encouraging active patient participation and ensuring far better compliance and patient satisfaction. </p>
<p>It was this very dream that inspired Dr. Aniruddha and Dr. Anjali Malpani, who founded HELP in 1997, with a dream to make each and every individual in this country aware of his rights and responsibilities as a patient, of ways people could reduce the burden of health care expenses by planning and educating themselves &quot;before&quot; a serious medical problem could strike their family, and how doctors and patients could join hands to achieve health for all.</p>
<p>What started as a resource center eleven years back, with a modest collection of material on patient education, in their day care center at Om Chambers, has grown into India&#39;s only largest patient education center housing more than 11,000 authentic books on possibly every aspect of health and diseases, along with pamphlets, health care magazines, and an exhaustive audiovisual section too. </p>
<p>HELP was also documented to be the world&#39;s largest Free library on consumer health information in the Limca book of records. State of the art infertility specialists to the world, Founders and visionaries for HELP, our Medical Directors have paved the path for the new &quot;patient-centric health care&quot;revolution in India.</p>
