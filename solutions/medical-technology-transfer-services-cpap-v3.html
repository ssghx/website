        <h3>Solution Overview &amp; Benefits</h3>
        <div data-render-html="/solutions/medical-technology-transfer-services-cpap-v3"><p>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy supports the airways of pre-term and low-birth weight newborns, who can breathe spontaneously but inadequately. It is a comfortable alternative to relatively invasive therapies, such as endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>The CPAP V3 system is designed to protect compromised airways, enhancing patient comfort and optimizing infant outcomes. Its continuous gentle pressure of air decreases the baby’s work of breathing by keeping the alveoli of the lungs open, which enables efficient capillary exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to take place. This also helps establish and maintain functional residual capacity, while preventing collapse and upper airway obstruction. The CPAP V3 also reduces apnea, bradycardia and cyanotic episodes.</p>
<p>The CPAP V3 provides a noninvasive, clinically effective and safe therapy to treat newborns and infants with respiratory distress syndrome and other common respiratory pathologies. It accurately mixes air with oxygen, adds humidity to the gas mixture, and then delivers it to the patient at precisely-controlled flow rate.</p>
<p>100% reusable and cleanable, no disposable parts.
Cost effective.
Easy installation and maintenance.
Includes gas mixing, humidification, PEEP chamber, air compressor in one unit.
Includes user manual and training video.</p>

          <h3>History &amp; Development</h3>
          <div data-render-html="/solutions/medical-technology-transfer-services-cpap-v3#history-and-development"><p>The CPAP (Continuous Positive Air Pressure) system was developed by Medical Technology Transfer and Services (MTTS) in cooperation with Vietnam National Hospital of Pediatrics (NHP), to respond to the country’s needs for low-cost, high-quality equipment to overcome the high neonatal mortality due to Respiratory Distress of premature babies. Respiratory Distress caused 80% of neonatal mortality at NHP, and nationwide 45% of newborns with Respiratory Distress died within 24 hours from birth in 2005. At that time, neonatal emergency care was concentrated in central hospitals which had limited equipment and were hard to reach for most families, therefore many infants were left without adequate care. After implementing MTTS equipment at the national, provincial and referral hospitals, the neonatal 24h-mortality has decreased significantly both at the NHP and in the whole country.</p>
<p>The equipment has been developed and produced in Vietnam by Medical Technology Transfer and Services (MTTS) on the base of Western standards, but with adjustments to the needs and requirements of low-cost settings and tropical climates. Priorities for MTTS are ease of use, affordability, durability, safety and precise measurement. The CPAP has been distributed mostly through the East Meets West Foundation’s Breath of Life Program, combined with intensive training, follow up, data collection and technical assistance.</p>
