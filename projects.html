          <div data-render-html="/solutions/population-services-international-psi-clean-delivery-kit"><p>In developing countries, many women have no access to maternity services due to distance to health facilities, cost for medical services and products and local customs, often resulting in unhygienic delivery conditions that increase rates of infant and maternal tetanus and other life-threatening infections.</p>
<p>To make delivery safer by preventing infection, PSI offers clean delivery kits in multiple countries and regions.</p>
<p>A clean delivery kit provides the necessary tools and instructions to achieve the World Health Organization’s “Five Cleans” throughout the birthing process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean hands. Wash hands with clean water and soap, once before delivery and once before cord cutting.</li>
<li>Clean delivery surface. A plastic sheet for mothers to lie upon during delivery maintains a clean birth canal and perineum, and protects the newborn from potential sources of infection.</li>
<li>Clean cord cut. A new razor blade in its original packing is sterile and can prevent the transmission of tetanus-causing spores and other pathogenic organisms via the umbilicus to the infant.</li>
<li>Clean cord ties. Additionally, the use of clean thread or narrow tape to tightly tie the umbilicus helps keep the stump healthy.</li>
<li>Clean cord stump care. Applying antiseptic such as chlorhexidine to the cord stump to prevent infection is the best care.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where permitted by local regulations, PSI clean delivery kits may also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The antiseptic chlorhexidine for newborn skin washing and umbilical cord cleaning. Chlorhexidine has been shown to reduce newborn deaths by as much as 23 percent when applied within the first 24 hours of birth.</li>
<li>Misoprostol pills. A uterotonic drug which contracts the uterus, these pills can help to prevent excessive bleeding. Excessive bleeding after delivery, called postpartum hemorrhage, is the single biggest direct cause of maternal deaths – more than 220 women die of it every day. </li>
</ul>
<p>Misoprostol taken immediately after delivery significantly decreases a woman’s risk of postpartum hemorrhage and does not require refrigeration or injection, making it possible for a woman to take it after a home delivery without a trained attendant.</p>

It serves as a principal vehicle for micro-enterprises, while providing local communities or social institutions with high-quality nutrition. Operating without the need for any electricity supply or generator, it uses locally-available fuels - including wood, biomass or bottled gas - for operation.</p>
<p>The full system includes three components: </p>
<p>-The PedalPro system which performs the grinding function for soybeans and other foods, as well as pedal-operated battery charging and water pumping
-A stainless steel pressure-cooking vessel and a stainless steel filter press
-A pressurized stainless steel steam boiler</p>
<p>The use of steam-injected pressure-cooking is up to ten times more energy-efficient than traditional open stove cooking. Some foods can also be prepared using only the pedal-operated grinder/blender, and do not require the boiler and pressure-cooker. A standalone electric grinder is also an available component for the VitaGoat system. The electric grinder can be ordered at the same time as the system or purchased at a later date. </p>
<p>The VitaGoat can process economical, high-protein and healthy soya foods in the form of soy milk, and its derivatives such as tofu and yogurt. Other cooked and processed foods such as soups, sauces and purees, can be made from various fruits and vegetables. An extra food-preserving vessel is in development to allow for long shelf-life. The cycle-grinder alone can process peanut butter, soy and other nut butters, and grind cereals and grains into meals and some flours.</p>

<p>One of the coaching programs is the Aina Device, a mobile diagnostic platform that measures the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood Glucose</li>
<li>HbA1C</li>
<li>Lipids-HDL,LDL,TrG</li>
<li>Creatinine</li>
<li>Haemoglobin</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) curriculum, Jana Care created an online lifestyle program called &quot;Habits,&quot; in order to complement the Aina Device. The DPP proved that 7% weight loss reduces diabetes by 58%. Habits provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifestyle coaching through interactive reality TV shows</li>
<li>Mobile apps for diet and exercise tracking</li>
<li>Support from certified diabetes educators</li>

<p>ReSoMal was developed to meet this specific need. It must not be given to well-nourished people or those suffering from cholera (in these cases standard ORSs, which conform to the WHO formula, must be used). </p>
<p>Recommendations for use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The quantity to be given depends on the weight of the patient. A dose of 70-100ml per kg is usually sufficient to re-establish normal hydration (on average, one sachet of ReSoMal will, therefore, be enough to rehydrate four children who weigh 7 kg each).</li>
<li>The exact quantity depends on what the child drinks, the volume of continuing loss (stools, vomit) and the possible appearance of signs of hyperhydration (particularly symptoms of cardiac insufficiency).</li>

<p>With Duranet LLINs, the insecticide is incorporated into the fiber and is control released over time. Just the right amount of insecticide migrates to the surface over the product&#39;s entire lifespan. As a result, Duranets do not need to be retreated with insecticide like traditional surface treated polyester nets. With insecticide incorporated into the net fibers instead of on the surface, Duranet allows for the safe transport and handling of large quantities of nets.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional mosquito nets, Duranets are slightly rigid, which allows for increased air flow through the nets. As a result, users remain cool while they sleep. Duranet LLINs are available in a variety of colors, including dark colors, which do not need to be washed as frequently as white nets. Duranet® LLINs will maintain their effectiveness for a lifetime of up to 5 years, which is almost twice as long as the lifespan of all polyester nets on the market. </p>

<ol>
<li>Skin-to-skin contact between the baby&#39;s front and the mother&#39;s chest: Skin-to-skin contact should ideally start at birth, but is helpful at any time. It should ideally be continuous day and night, but shorter periods are still helpful. </li>
<li>Exclusive breastfeeding: for an average mother, direct suckling by the baby from the breasts is all that is needed. For very premature babies, milk and additional essential nutrients may be needed. </li>
<li>Support of the dyad: whatever is needed for the medical, emotional, psychological and physical well-being of mother and baby is provided to them without separating them. This might mean adding ultramodern equipment, if available, or purely intense psychological support in low-resource settings. </li>

<p>Every TB evaluation unit consists of a semi-automated cage, featuring ten holes and an automated food pellet dispenser. Beneath each of the ten holes, saliva samples are presented for odor discrimination by rats. The lids are uncovered one-by-one and the animals sniff hole-per-hole for positive targets. Every hole is equipped with a laser beam, broken by the nose of the rat. A rat only needs a few hundredths of a second to discriminate the target odor. In case of a negative sample the rat immediately moves on to the next sample. Positive samples are indicated by keeping their nose fixed in the sniffer hole for at least three seconds, which is registered in a database.</p>
<p>Known positives are inserted to allow reinforcement of indication behavior. At three seconds indication of known positive samples, the animals hear a click sound and they receive a food reward. Rat-detected suspect samples are re-tested for the presence of TB using concentrated smear and LED microscopy.</p>
<p>The rats evaluate 100 saliva samples within 20 minutes, which would take a lab technician more than two days using microscopy. So far more than 5,800 TB patients who were initially missed by means of microscopy have been positively diagnosed, thus preventing 87,000 potential infections. </p>
<p>APOPO has managed to increase the TB case detection rate by an average of 40%.</p>

Here&#39;s how it works: The lens consists of two optical lenses with third grade surfaces. Because one lens is the exact inversion of the other, the moment they are placed exactly behind each other the strength of the lens is zero. Converting the lens along the x-axis changes the intensity of the Alvarez lens. Doing the same thing for the y-axis changes the astigmatic correction of the Alvarez lens. The Alvarez lens rectifies all refraction and astigmatic deviations by displacing one lens over the x- and y-axis and by turning the complete lens around the z-axis (optical axis).    </p>
<p>The lenses of the Focusspec are made of high-quality polycarbonate. The frame and temples are made of industrial-grade plastics. The frame, lenses and the worm wheel are put together by ultrasonic welding, making the spectacles less vulnerable to dust and dirt. Silicone parts are used in the newest model of the Focusspec to make the glasses fit around different noses. </p>
<p>Approximately 80% of the people who need refractive correction can be helped with Focusspec glasses.</p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/appropriate-technology-collaborative-solar-vaccine-refrigerator"><p>The Solar Vaccine Refrigerator is made from locally sourced materials such as steel, charcoal, and ethanol or methanol. The fridge is made with a steel box, which is painted black and serves as a solar collector and absorber. The charcoal in the fridge rejects ethanol vapor when the steel box becomes hot, which flows into the condenser. </p>
<p>The condenser is made up of a series of pipes with cooling fins, where the ethanol vapor condenses into a liquid by reducing the temperature to the ambient air temperature. The evaporator, located inside the insulated box, captures the liquid which results in liquid ethanol in the evaporator and cool charcoal in the absorber. </p>
<p>The ethanol that is not absorbed back into the charcoal becomes very cold and results in the cold temperature inside the box, usually -10C to 0C degrees. </p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/intellectual-ventures-lab-passive-vaccine-storage-device"><p>The Passive Vaccine Storage Device is designed to keep vaccines at the appropriate temperatures for a month or more without electricity. The device combines the best attributes of vaccine cold boxes and stationary refrigerators currently used in the cold chain. Unlike other vaccine cold boxes, the device holds temperatures for at least a month, instead of only one to five days. Unlike refrigerators, it is transportable, low-cost, low-maintenance, and can be used anywhere.</p>
<p>The Passive Vaccine Storage Device uses super insulation techniques similar to those used to store cryogenic fluids; its design is specific to vaccine storage and can maintain the necessary temperatures for months using only ice.  Vaccines can then be retrieved without jeopardizing the remaining vials and the insulated container can remain in the field for repeated use.</p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/intellectual-ventures-lab-photonic-fence"><p>The Photonic Fence is a prototype device that is capable of identifying the discriminating characteristics of a mosquito (wing beat frequency, shape, size, airspeed, etc.).  Once a mosquito has been identified, a trained laser delivers photonic energy to kill or incapacitate it.  Designed for use in developing regions, the photonic fence will be used to complement bed nets, insecticides, and other existing vector control techniques. </p>
<p>One potential use of the Photonic Fence is to create a virtual fence that detects insects as they cross its plane. When an invading insect is detected, custom software is able to estimate the insect’s size and also to measure its wing beat frequency. Using this method, not only can the system distinguish between mosquitoes, butterflies, and bumblebees, but it can also determine whether a mosquito is male or female, as only female mosquitoes bite humans.</p>
<p>Once the software establishes that the insect is a valid target, it tracks the mosquito in flight, runs a safety check to ensure no innocent bystanders are in view, and then activates a laser to zap the mosquito. The Photonic Fence could be set along the perimeter of clinics or other strategic areas to control mosquitoes without endangering humans or other animals.</p>

The elliptical polished, unbreakable lenses are given the notches and steps for fastening in the spectacle frames on the milling attachment and can be inserted in no time. This milling machine can be operated via a decentralized power supply thanks to the low power consumption (generator or solar station). Heat-shrinkable sleeves made of hypoallergenic plastic on the ear piece ends increase the wearing comfort of the glasses. Because the glasses have very little weight, they do not require nosebridges.

These conditions claim the lives of an estimated 63,000 women each year, as well as the lives of many of their babies.1 Where a woman gives birth should not decide her fate, and yet the risk that a woman in a developing country will die of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is approximately 300 times higher than that for a woman in a developed country.1  Several studies have identified magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) as the most effective anticonvulsant for preventing and treating the life-threatening seizures of eclampsia.  MgSO4 is needed at every level of the health care system where deliveries occur, from urban hospitals to rural clinics.2  Most of women with pre-eclampsia will also require antihypertensive therapy, even while on MgSO4.10 Supportive policies and appropriate practices are required to take this important medicine to scale to help reach the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 target: reducing maternal mortality by 75% by 2015. </p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/american-academy-of-pediatrics-helping-babies-breathe"><p>Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) is an evidence-based educational program to teach neonatal resuscitation techniques in resource-limited areas. It is an initiative of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), US Agency for International Development (USAID), Saving Newborn Lives, the National Institute of Child Health and Development, and a number of other global health organizations.</p>
<p>The objective of HBB is to train birth attendants in developing countries in the essential skills of newborn resuscitation, with the goal of having at least one person who is skilled in neonatal resuscitation at the birth of every baby.</p>
<p>A key concept of HBB is The Golden Minute ®: Within one minute of birth, a baby should be breathing well or should be ventilated with a bag and mask. The Golden Minute identifies the steps that a birth attendant must take immediately after birth to evaluate the baby and stimulate breathing.</p>
<p>The HBB curriculum is designed to be used as part of a coordinated educational approach to early neonatal care and can be effectively combined with other curricula. It can be locally taught to birth attendants in diverse venues and locations. HBB focuses on practices that all persons who care for babies at birth can learn to care for healthy babies and/or assist babies who do not breathe on their own.</p>

This project involves the design and production of a comfortable, variable impedance prosthetic (VIPr) socket using digital anatomical data for a transtibial amputee using computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM). The VIPr socket uses multiple materials to achieve compliance, thereby increasing socket comfort for amputees, while maintaining structural integrity. The compliant features are seamlessly integrated into the 3D printed socket to achieve lower interface peak pressures over bony protuberances and other anatomical points in comparison to a conventional socket. This lower peak pressure is achieved through a design that uses anthropomorphic data acquired through surface scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques. A mathematical transformation maps the quantitative measurements of the human residual limb to the corresponding socket shape and impedance characteristics, spatially.</p>

Jaundice is a serious health risk for babies if left untreated. Because of the high price of standard phototherapy devices, most hospitals in the developing world either do not have phototherapy or have substandard devices that provide ineffective treatment.</p>
<p>Brilliance has been optimized for these settings with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brilliance LEDs last 16-25x longer than compact fluorescent tube lights commonly used in phototherapy devices in low-resource hospitals. With Brilliance, hospitals can save over $200 per year on costly bulb replacements;</li>
<li>Brilliance consumes half the power of compact fluorescent tube lights. In case of blackout, it can be run off a battery back-up (the size of a car battery) for up to 8 hours;</li>
<li>Designed for extreme durability including protections against voltage surges, high use and other environmental challenges with minimal required maintenance;</li>
<li>Height and tilt adjustments to accommodate use with other critical NICU devices and meets UNICEF phototherapy specifications and can be used with hospital beds, bassinets and other treatment surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas the standard compact fluorescent light phototherapy devices only treat 42 babies before bulb replacement is required to maintain its effectiveness, a Brilliance device is estimated to treat approximately 1,042 babies.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 6000 million people are hearing impaired, This is because of lack of prevention and treatment of diseases as well as higher noise pollution in several employment sectors. In its more severe form, this disorder is keeping otherwise healthy children and adults from going to school and working as they are considered deaf, even if they are not. The extent of hearing loss leads to poverty and hardship in the families and communities affected, and through extension, to the larger society. Those effected suffer from the lack of educational and occupational opportunities. People with disabilities account for a higher per cent age of unemployed than national average and have less access to education and training, as well as a higher incidence of HIV.</p>
<p>Through a Brazilian Foundation, Instituto CEFAC plus a social marketing organization Legar, plus several University stakeholders and in conjunction with the youths who are deaf, from an NGO in Africa, Solar Ear Brazil, manufactures, assembles and distributes, the first digital rechargeable hearing aid, a new solar battery charger and rechargeable hearing aid batteries which costs the same as disposible zinc air batteries, but lasts 2 to 3 years. All products are assembled by young employees who are deaf. By developing practical technologies for the region and creating employment, training and education programs, this project is a sustainable professional enterprise, as well as effect the way civil society views the skills of people with disabilities.</p>

With the Breath Abacus, however, allied health workers can simply slide the beads to count a child&#39;s respiration rate. The beads are color coded to determine the final diagnosis. An hourglass connected to the abacus counts down for one minute; if a red bead is counted before one minute is up, pneumonia can be diagnosed with high accuracy. The abacus can be constructed with local materials according to the image shown in the solution description.</p>

In developed nations IV drips are delivered by electric pumps when dosing accuracy is needed. These provide and accurate and consistent flow but are expensive and require electricity. IV drips can be administered by gravity but current valves are not intuitive and require practice to use. In emergencies untrained persons are often performing IV administration and may give an incorrect dose due to the design of these valves. This improved valve adjusts flow volume linearly based on the position of a wheel. It is similar to existing designs but the groove the tube sits on is curved, which means the wheel compresses the tube gradually as it is spun up the track on the valve.This makes it easier to use and allows a scale to be printed on the valve body showing what the flow rate is at any given position. Flow rate can be adjusted quickly and with more certainty. This relatively simple design change to an existing product could save lives from medication errors.</p>

A series of mirrors reflects sunlight, concentrating rays of light onto a closed bucket which acts as a &quot;pressure cooker&quot;. The heat generated inside is well over the required minimum for sterilization; any instruments placed inside the vessel will be sterile and ready for use. The Solarclave&#39;s unique design optimally traps the heat reflected by the mirrors, making effective use of materials and time. The parts can be produced using locally-sourced materials (in Nicaragua thus far) and community groups like Las Mujeres Solares have been been trained to quickly assemble these units. The simple assembly also means that the Solarclave can also be transported to other rural clinics for use within the same day.</p>

Cervical cancer accounts for 30% of all female cancer deaths worldwide. Regular screenings and Pap smears are expensive and often difficult to administer and verify in rural areas. VIA/cryo is a &#39;one-stop&#39; alternative that utilizes household vinegar to coat the cervix and expose pre-cancerous tumors by blanching them. Nurses trained in the procedure can then administer cryotherapy by freezing off pre-cancerous lesions. Cryotherapy can be conducted anywhere with access to carbon dioxide tanks, commonly found in Coca-Cola or other major bottling factories.</p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/diagnostics-for-all-liver-function-test"><p>DFA’s first project is a rapid, low-cost, point-of-care diagnostic device to monitor liver function. While many of the highly potent drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and TB are toxic to the liver, deaths due to drug-induced liver failure are very rare in countries like the United States, where a patient’s liver function is monitored regularly. Yet this is not the case in resource-poor countries, where roughly 20% of TB patients and 25% of HIV/AIDS patients, lacking access to diagnostic tools, succumb to liver complications related to their treatment.</p>
<p>Designed specifically for use in the developing world, DFA’s device will enable semi-quantitative determination of two key liver enzymes, AST (aspartate transaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase), which are routinely used to measure liver toxicity amongst patients receiving antiretroviral medications. As the liver becomes damaged by potent medications, these two enzymes, usually found in the liver, are released into the blood stream. From a single drop of whole blood, this test will determine whether blood levels of these two enzymes are baseline/normal, greater than two-times baseline/normal, or greater than five-times baseline/normal. The 2x and 5x thresholds, which indicate that treatments should be “monitored closely” or “altered immediately”, correspond to protocols established by the U.S. FDA to guide treatment during clinical trials.</p>
<p>The liver function test is targeted to cost $0.10 or less, will be about the size of a postage stamp, and will function without external power or equipment. The output will be a straightforward, semi-quantitative colorimetric indication of enzyme levels and will be easily integrated into telemedicine networks.</p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/zana-africa-sanitary-pads-for"><p>Globally, 150 million children currently enrolled in school may drop out before completing primary school - at least 100 million of these are girls. Kenyan adolescent girls miss approximately 3.5 million learning days per month due to lack of funds to purchase sanitary pads. This impedes their ability to compete in the classroom, leads to low self-esteem, higher drop-out rates and, in many areas of Kenya, makes them vulnerable to early marriage. </p>
<p>ZanaA has found a long-term and holistic solution to this problem, which is to establish a sustainable business creating locally-produced, environmentally-safe sanitary pads in Kenya while advocating for greater policy support of girls. </p>
<p>First, ZanaA plans to coordinate, on-line, the national distribution of sanitary pads, to ensure all vendors are distributing proper sanitary pads and with synchronized training in sanitary pad use and disposal as well as age-appropriate sexual maturation education.</p>
<p>This will help reduce the logistical burden of sanitary pad distribution, ensure sexual predators are not given entry to the school, distribute pads at the convenience of the school curriculum, enable equitable distribution across the country, and reduce the cost burden to donors. Along with this comes the development of a tool kit for enhancing policy around girls and education.</p>
<p>Second, ZanaA has become the exclusive distributor to the informal market (including school girls) for a sanitary pad invented by Dr. Musaazi of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, called MakaPads™, made from local, easily replenishable natural resources.</p>
<p>MakaPads has been approved by the Ugandan Bureau of Standards, is in the final stage of registering with the Kenyan Bureau of Standards, and is pending international patent. This is the first of several solutions, to provide sanitary pad production opportunities using available natural resources.</p>
<p>Third, ZanaA is interesting in networking with any producers of sanitary pads and any organizations who provide or who are planning to provide sanitary pads to schools because the world can handle many solutions for different contexts. We are particularly interested in leveraging agricultural waste.</p>

<p>This team of biomedical engineers is working closely with Jhpiego, the leading NGO in maternal and child healthcare, to develop an antenatal screening kit to deliver low-cost healthcare to women in even the remotest villages. The kit includes a variety of custom markers pre-filled with reagents for screening tests. The tests are intuitive and simple to use, allowing a semi-trained community health worker to mark a piece of paper and create a custom dipstick for the mother. The kit contains seven tests for conditions including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, malnutrition, and anemia. The team is pilot testing the kit in Nepal.</p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/path-silcs-diaphragm"><p>Despite the success of family planning programs since the 1960s, the unmet worldwide need for contraception remains high, with an estimated 120 million couples not having access to contraceptives. Each year, nearly 80 million women experience unintended pregnancies, about half of these end in abortion. Hundreds of millions of women annually suffer disability from pregnancy complications, and more than 500,000 die as a result of pregnancy, childbirth, or unsafe abortion. Almost all these deaths are preventable. Women also represent more than 50 percent of people living with AIDS; and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), excluding HIV/AIDS, are the second most important cause of loss of health in women, especially young women. Women want and need more female-initiated methods that can protect against pregnancy and STIs. Diaphragms could help meet this need, but some characteristics of traditional diaphragms limit their use and acceptability.</p>
<p>PATH responded to the call for simple-to-use, female barrier protection by developing the SILCS Diaphragm, a single-size, reusable device with a contoured rim that allows the SILCS Diaphragm to fit most women with improved comfort. Design and development of the SILCS Diaphragm began in 1994, and user-centered evaluations of over 200 prototype designs refined performance and features. The single-size design will simplify the logistics of supply and provision. PATH used stakeholder assessments to ensure that comfort, ease of handling, and acceptability were built into the product. As a result, the SILCS Diaphragm directly addresses user and programmatic needs which will lead to improved access and acceptability. Acceptability studies among naïve users in South Africa and  Thailand found that women were able to learn to use the device easily and that women and men found the SILCS Diaphragm acceptable during use. In a comparative crossover study of the SILCS Diaphragm with a traditional diaphragm in the Dominican Republic, 19 of 20 women reported preferring the SILCS Diaphragm device after short-term use. Eventually, the single-size device could be provided over the counter or outside the clinic-based system where regulatory authority and clinical practice allow.</p>

Birth asphyxia/trauma—the condition when a baby does not breathe at birth—is the third most common cause of newborn deaths, accounting for 23 percent of all fatalities. Limited data suggest that deaths due to birth asphyxia have remained relatively unchanged in developing countries. The key to reducing these deaths is the provision of appropriate care to underserved populations during delivery. Approximately 50 million women give birth without a skilled attendant, 99 percent of whom live in low-income countries. Appropriate care for birth asphyxia requires that neonatal resuscitation skills and appropriate technology should be available to all skilled birth attendants and to community-level workers where skilled attendants are not available.</p>
<p>Effective neonatal resuscitation equipment is needed by all birth attendants in order to reduce the danger of birth asphyxiation. Neonatal resuscitator technologies that are affordable and easy to use, clean, and store could increase the use of such lifesaving devices in the developing world. While currently available neonatal resuscitation devices are available in both bag and mask designs and tube and mask designs, their accessibility is limited in some world regions due to poor availability and affordability. The estimated potential impact of widespread introduction and use of neonatal resuscitators could be about one million neonatal deaths averted annually.</p>

The World Health Organization/Expanded Programme on Immunization (WHO/EPI) called for the design of such devices in 1987.</p>
<p>In response to WHO’s call, PATH designed one of the first feasible approaches to nonreusable syringes for immunizations: an autodisable (AD) syringe with a fixed needle that automatically locks after a single injection. When the syringe is filled to the preset 0.5-ml level, the plunger stops and cannot be pulled back further. After the vaccine is injected, the plunger automatically locks so that the syringe and needle cannot be reused. Known as the SoloShot syringe, this technology was licensed to and is now manufactured and marketed by BD, one of the world’s leading syringe manufacturers. Third-party field validations of the device in Pakistan in the early 1990s demonstrated the acceptability and usability of the design. PATH also has assisted several other manufacturers of AD syringes to ensure a wide variety of products are available and to facilitate the lower pricing that accompanies increased competition and production volume.</p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/path-intradermal-adapter"><p>Rabies vaccine is expensive and often in short supply—approximately 20,000 people die of rabies each year in India, often because they were unable to access treatment. For rabies vaccine, the same or better protection can be achieved by delivering smaller amounts of vaccine intradermally (into the top layer of the skin), sparing valuable doses and stretching supplies to provide for more patients. Intradermal (ID) regimens for rabies vaccine have been adopted in many regions, protecting people who have been exposed to rabid animals, while saving costs and vaccine.</p>
<p>This approach is not yet universal, despite clear benefits, due in part to the difficulty of giving an ID injection correctly. The Mantoux technique, which uses a traditional needle and syringe for ID delivery, has historically been recognized as a difficult and inconsistently used technique. In many countries, only certain health care workers are able to perform ID injections, such as for rabies vaccine and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin or BCG, a vaccine given intradermally at birth to prevent tuberculosis. Smaller ID doses of other vaccines could also be effective. Such dose sparing could be particularly meaningful to immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries, as they could potentially reduce the amount of vaccine needed per patient, thereby cutting costs and overcoming vaccine shortages. However, concerns regarding the difficulty and a lack of reliability of conventional ID injections limit research in this field and introduction of this technique into immunization programs. </p>
<p>The intradermal adapter makes ID injections easier. It facilitates the procedure by standardizing injection depth and angle. It is anticipated that the ID adapter would expand the pool of health care workers capable of performing the procedure. This would have a particularly high impact in remote or underserved communities with more limited access to health care specialists.</p>

          <h2><a href="./solutions/path-birthweigh">BIRTHweigh</a></h2>
          <div data-render-html="/solutions/path-birthweigh"><p>Low birth weight is the invisible undertow for infants in the developing world, where 95 percent of underweight children are born. Babies who don’t weigh enough at birth are terribly vulnerable. Their bodies are not strong, and they may have a difficult time breathing, eating, gaining weight, and fighting infection. Babies who weigh less than 2.5 kg at birth are approximately 20 times more likely to die than heavier infants.</p>
<p>Many babies in the developing world are delivered at home, by traditional birth attendants or midwives who may lack the training and tools to recognize low birth weight. PATH’s BIRTHweigh scale helps low-literate health workers identify low-birthweight children immediately. Once identified, these infants can be given care, such as immediate breastfeeding and warming, or referred for higher levels of medical care. The BIRTHweigh scale compensates for low levels of literacy by supplying pictorial instructions for use. It depends on a simple indicator for low birth weight and is easy to use; little training is required, allowing health workers in the developing world to detect low birth weight in infants before complications arise.</p>
<p>To use the BIRTHweigh scale, health workers place the baby in a secure sling that is suspended by a hook on the scale. Instead of the common digital or dial readouts that report an infant’s exact weight, the first version of the scale had a window that shows yellow if the baby’s weight is too low and blue if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kg, the desired weight for a healthy newborn.</p>
<p>During tests in Indonesia—where 250,000 Indonesian infants die each year from preventable illnesses—we found that during night deliveries, in huts with little or no lighting, birth attendants were unable see the color change. PATH took the recommendations of the midwives and field testers and modified the scale to include a tactile indicator on the top of the handle. The indicator button sinks into the grip if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kilograms, and birth attendants can feel whether babies are at a healthy weight, even in the dark.</p>

When the Ultra Rice grains are blended with white rice—usually in a ratio of about 1 to 100—the result is nearly identical to unfortified rice in smell, taste, and texture.</p>
<p>The technology is ingenious in its ability to protect micronutrients within the manufactured grain. In addition to preventing them from being rinsed away, the Ultra Rice grains preserve sensitive micronutrients from degradation during storage. Currently, there are two formulations of Ultra Rice. One carries vitamin A, and the other can carry iron, thiamin, folic acid, and zinc.</p>
<p>The Ultra Rice technology can be adapted to contain just the nutrients a population needs—and to mimic the look of the local rice. Its versatility allows grains that look like the short-grained rice of China to carry one combination of vitamins and minerals, while grains resembling the longer, thinner rice in Brazil deliver a completely different combination of micronutrients.</p>

          <div data-render-html="/solutions/sumitomo-chemical-olyset-net"><p>Traditional mosquito nets require regular dipping in insecticide to maintain effectiveness in repelling mosquitoes, as insecticide is dislodged during regular use and washing. There are also practical problems in re-treating nets in remote areas, a long way from the urban centres where stocks of insecticide and trained advisors are located. </p>
<p>Sumitomo Chemical engineers set about developing the first net that does not need this constant re-treatment. The process begins with insecticide-impregnated beads, which are extruded into fiber and warped onto bobbins to be knitted into rolls of netting.</p>
<p>The netting rolls are cut into sized panels which are machine-stitched into the nets themselves. Chemical and physical checks are made before the nets are sent for delivery by land, sea and air. Because the insecticide is incorporated within the fibers, Olyset Nets are truly ready-to-use, long-lasting and never in need of treatment. Washing does not diminish their effectiveness, and they have been shown to still repel mosquitoes seven years after initially being put into use.</p>
<p>Key features: </p>
<p>-Guaranteed to last at least five years. Research indicates that a seven-year life is often achievable.
-Tough – Olyset Net uses polyethylene technology that makes the net stronger and more tear resistant than polyester nets.
-Controlled release technology – unlike polyester nets, the insecticide in Olyset Net is contained within the fibre, not coated on the outside. This technology provides a slow release of the active ingredient which continues to control mosquitoes for more than five years.
-Quadruple insecticide effect on mosquitoes – bite inhibition, repellency, knockdown, kill. All contribute to protection from biting mosquitoes and other insects.</p>

In remote parts of the developing world, the reliability of electricity or fuel is often low, and energy needs must be consistently met in order to preserve vaccines, for example. KXN Nigeria Ltd. has developed a refrigerator system that utilizes a photovoltaic module for constant, reliable power.</p>
<p>The RFVB-134a, a refrigerator designed by Sun Frost, has 38.7 liters of capacity. At this relatively small size, this refrigerator can hold over 70,000 polio vaccines. In the hot climate of rural Nigeria, it is important to keep these vaccines cooled to 3 degrees celsius to prevent degradation. KXN Nigeria Ltd. provides rural health centers with a solar PV module, battery, and charge controller along with this refrigerator. The refrigerator consumes an average of 03.kWh of electricity per day, and the lead-acid solar batter is designed to withstand the unique discharging cycles required by the unit.</p>
