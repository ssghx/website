<h2 id="what-is-south-south-cooperation-">What is South-South cooperation?</h2>
<p>South-South cooperation is a broad framework for collaboration among countries of the South in political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, and technical domains. Involving two or more developing countries, it can take place on a bilateral, regional, sub-regional, or interregional basis. Developing countries share knowledge, skills, expertise, and resources to meet their development goals through concerted efforts. Recent developments in South-South cooperation have taken the form of increased volume of South-South trade, South-South flows of foreign direct investment, movements toward regional integration, technology transfers, sharing of solutions and experts, and other forms of exchanges.</p>

What is the mandate of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation?</p>
<p>The United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) was established in 1978 by the UN General Assembly with the mandate to promote, coordinate and support South-South and North-South-South (triangular) cooperation globally and within the United Nations system. UNOSSC leverages its global reach and policy and institutional capacities to assist UN agencies and developing countries to strengthen their South-South cooperation capacities. It has designed an innovative 3-in-1 delivery mechanism, endorsed by the UN General Assembly that effectively identifies, shares, and transfers successful Southern-generated development solutions for capacity building and knowledge sharing.</p>

SS-GHX was established in 2011 in cooperation with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office of the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).</p>
